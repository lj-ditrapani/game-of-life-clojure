Conway's Game of Life
=====================

Conway's Game of Life on 2-D toroidal grid.
Inspired by the version in Chapter 3 of
_Clojure Programming: Practical Lisp for the Java World_
by Chas Emerick, Brian Carper, and Christophe Grand and
published by O'Reilly in 2012.

A simple command-line implementation.

Years ago, I implemented a graphical _game of life_ in JavaScript and
when I saw the version in the Clojure book, I had to try it out myself.
